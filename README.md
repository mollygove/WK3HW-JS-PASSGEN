# WK3HW-JS-PASSGEN

## Description

This week we are modifing starter code that enables us to generate random passwords based on criteria that the user has selected. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It also responds to the users interface and adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. OWASP Foundation

# Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

Special characters list was used from the OWASP Foundation.
