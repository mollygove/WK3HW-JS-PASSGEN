# WK3HW-JS-PASSGEN

## Description

This week we are modifing starter code that enables us to generate random passwords based on criteria that the user has selected. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It also responds to the users interface and adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. OWASP Foundation

# Usage

User clicks button to generate a password.

After clicking, user is prompted with questions regarding a. criteria & b. options for password:

Criteria:
Must be between 8 and 128 characters long
Must choose at least 1 of the character options:
numbers
lower case letter
upper case letter
and/or special character
Options:
User chooses length of PW within the criteria
User can choose which/some/or all of the PW character choices: (must include at least 1 option per criteria above)
numbers
lower case letter
upper case letter
special character
Upon answering the prompts the password will generate and appear in the box.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
