# WK3HW-JS-PASSGEN

## Description

This week we are modifing starter code that enables us to generate random passwords based on criteria the user has selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

# Usage
* User clicks button to generate a password.

* After clicking, user is prompted with questions regarding criteria for password:

Criteria:
- Must be between 8 and 128 characters long
- User chooses length of PW within the criteria
- User can choose which/some/or all of the PW character choices: 
- numbers
- lower case letter
- upper case letter
- special character

Upon answering the prompts the password will generate and appear in the box.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits
